## Gender and Speaker_Recognition using Machine Learning Models

#### **Overview**
This project aims to develop machine learning models for gender and speaker recognition from audio data. Using machine learning techniques, the system classifies speakers based on their gender and voice characteristics.

#### **Dataset**

- Audio data is collected in the Urdu language using tools like Praat.
- Features are extracted using Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to represent audio characteristics.

#### **Feature Extraction**

MFCC is used for feature extraction from audio files, which helps in capturing spectral and temporal features of the audio signals.

#### **Machine Learning Models**
1. Multinomial Logistic Regression
2. Multilayer Perceptron
3. Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes

#### **Workflow**
1. Data collection and preprocessing 
2. Feature extraction using MFCC
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Classification of gender and speaker based on trained models

#### **Technologies Used**

- Python libraries: sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- Machine Learning techniques: Supervised learning, Classification
- Tools: Praat, Python_speech_features

This project helps in speaker recognition and could be used in applications such as speech-based authentication, audio-based surveys, or language analysis systems.
